## Evmos <a href="#7brk" id="7brk"></a>

**EVMOS** is a blockchain fully compatible with Ethereum, built on the Cosmos SDK and running on Tendermint, providing a bridge between ETH and Cosmos. Founders [Federico Kunze KÃ¼hlmer](https://twitter.com/fekunze) at Cosmos since 2017, who worked on Gravity Bridge, Cosmos SDK, IBC and [Akash Khosla,](https://twitter.com/@akash\_khosla) who was previously a software engineer at Anchorage Digital.

### **History**

Initially, the concept of running Ethereum on top of Tendermint, conceived as far back as 2016, implied the scalability of the consensus protocol and was called Ethermint. But then Polygon, L2 came along, and the beginning of the scalability problem was set. The concept only became interesting to the Cosmos ecosystem, and the name Ethermint itself turned out to be a trademark owned by All in Bits Inc. - the company behind the Cosmos Hub launch. It was the first fakap on the way to deploying the hub, which was later called Evmos. The project raised 106,000 ATOM as seed money in proposal #44 (can view it [here](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/cosmoshub/governance?detailId=44))

### **How it works?**

Evmos is a fast EVM blockchain running on PoS. Thanks to its EVM compatibility, Fantom, BSC, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche and other networks can be integrated with Cosmos. Moreover, since there is, for example, Aurora, in fact Near can already be connected to Cosmos as well.

On the other hand, despite the fact that Cosmos tends to make blockchain for one task (app-chains), EVMOS already has NFT marketplaces, AMMs, and of course tinkerers.

By design, EVM interoperability will attract TVL to the ecosystem, due to the fact that developers of decentralized applications and smart contracts on Solidity may be attracted to PoS consensus, fast transactions, low fees and access to space . For example, AAVE successfully passed the AAVE Deployment Proposal to EVMOS (more [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb9f2a37fbc61a6fc02276a86d14c69ff234287426bd6726980834487d1c37c95)). By the way, due to the fact that AAVE contract is not a quick thing to deploy, EVMOS is still ruled by other AMMs: Diffusion (fork Uniswap v2), Cronus Finance, EvmoSwap (fork SushiSwap and PancakeSwap).

### **$Evmos**

As for the EVMOS token model, there is also an interest here. In this blockchain, they decided to make a fair distribution of tokens between developers, users, and validators.

When EVMOS was launched, 200 million tokens were dropped and distributed among Rektdrop members, the community, and the reserve.

Another 300 million tokens will be issued in the first year after the launch, and the plan is to issue a billion in total over 4 years! Yes, Evmos is highly inflation-prone, but it will go down every year. You can read more about tokenomics [here.](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b)

### **Collaborations**

EVMOS has weak marketing, but there are some interesting collabs, such as CEVMOS. It is a joint project with Celestia, which will probably make a breakthrough in blockchain scalability: they are separating the consensus level of chaining and data availability from the execution level. To make it even shorter, it is a modular blockchain for rollups. The network will be implemented on Optimint (Optimistic Tendermint). The plan is to connect the new network to the EVMOS Hub and use $Evmos for gas and security.

### The most interesting protocols in Evmos

1\. Diffusion. Number one in TVL is a fork of Uniswap. You can start swap [here](https://app.diffusion.fi/#/swap).

2\. Cronus Finance. Also Uniswap fork..

3\. EarnMos. This is a Yield aggregator. You can get a high APY, but remember high inflation;) Plus, it's Diffusion's closest TVL competitor.

4\. Orbit Marketplace. NFT on Evmos. You can flip, or you can catch, for example, Orbital Apes on floor. Speaking of these monkeys: they give you the right to take a bite out of the commissions on orbit marketplace.
