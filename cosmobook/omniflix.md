## Omniflix <a href="#oksn" id="oksn"></a>

OmniFlixNetwork (formerly FreeFlixMediaNetwork) is a p2p network for authors and communities to efficiently manage, distribute, and monetize user-generated content.

The network was created to solve three problems:

1\. Lack of audience reach;

2\. Lack of collaboration tools to create, distribute and monetize content;

3\. Lack of sovereign infrastructure for content distribution.

It is emphasized that this is a network, not a platform or an application. At the same time, OmniFlix is not a protocol, because it uses the existing set of protocols, which it implements if necessary. It develops the missing ones.

The OmniFlix network uses three types of nodes - a validator, a relay (relayer) and a storage node. The validator is responsible for creating blocks and participating in management (on behalf of delegators), the relayer is responsible for moving packets between networks, and the storage nodes are responsible for delivering content to the networks.

Even though the roadmap says the mainnet is scheduled for Q4 2022, you can already poke around and even buy NFT on the marketplace.

Right now, the ecosystem consists of just four elements: OmniFlixStudio, OmniFlixMarket, OmniFlixinSync, and StreamPay.

**OmniFlixStudio** is the basic app that lets you minify, manage, distribute, and monetize content.

**OmniFlixMarket** is used for listing, collecting and transferring tokens, including via IBC. The screenshot is a clear example of multichain - the initial gopnik mines on CosmosHub (and costs 2.28 ATOM, by the way).

**OmniFlixInSync** serves as a steaming, controlling, and voting for proposals. It's essentially analogous to a dApp from Kepplr, for example.

One notable dApp of the chane is a member of HackAtom IV, StreamPay's streaming payment service ([https://sp.omniflix.network/](https://sp.omniflix.network/)). StreamPay is a module like CosmWasm. It can be used on any chains of the Cosmos ecosystem. The service has its own token SPAY, but other IBC tokens are also supported, such as FLIX and JUNOX. The idea is this: Potap wants to pay for Liliana's services for 1 hour. He allocates 100 SPAY for this, puts Lily's wallet in the payment recipients, the date and time of the start and end of the service. And throughout the time, the payments will be evenly distributed in blocks. So far the service is quite primitive, but there are plans to implement stopping payments, adding on-chain start/stop triggers, adaptive change of payment share, etc.

Note that you can still try out the capabilities of the network, post a collection of NFT, fill it up, and also buy a picture for test tokens.
