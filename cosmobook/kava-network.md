## Kava Network

The Kava Network is a general-purpose network that uses the Tendermint core and consists of two so-called co-chains - the Cosmos co-chain and the Ethereum co-chain.

Cosmos co-chain is a blockchain based on Cosmos SDK, linked to most other blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. It became a full-fledged blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem in January 2022 with the launch of Kava 9 mainnet, whose main upgrade was the implementation of the IBC protocol. Thus, it was possible to transfer native KAVA tokens to other blockchains that use IBC, as well as transfer some IBC tokens to the Kava network.

Ethereum co-chain is an EVM compatible environment for running smart contracts and decentralized applications written in Solidity.

Ethereum co-chain was launched in May 2022 along with Kava 10 mainnet update. Currently, users only have the ability to wrap and unwrap the KAVA token via MetaMask. In fact, all the main functionality and features of this co-chain will be implemented in further updates after Ethereum Bridge launch.

Both cochains are connected by the Translator Module, which will allow them to communicate with each other without any problems in the future.

The Kava Network will be managed by KavaDAO and secured by native KAVA token stacking, while network stackers and validators will be able to participate in DAO votes and make suggestions about the operation of the network.

### **Defi products Kava Platform**

#### **Kava Mint**

Kava Mint (formerly Kava CDP) is a platform that allows users to borrow in USDX (Kava Network's native stablecoin) against certain assets with a collateral ratio of at least 150% (i.e. to borrow $100 you need to have a collateral asset worth at least $150).

The work of the platform is based on several basic modules:

CDP module (CDP stands for collateral debt position) is a Cosmos SDK module that allows you to implement work with collateral debt positions.

Auction module - the module that is responsible for the stable operation of the system and the USDX rate peg.

Price feed module - tracks price through Chainlink oracles.

BEP-3 module - acts as a secure bridge between Kava and Binance Chain.

Read more about liquidations on Kava Mint and Kava Lend [here](https://medium.com/kava-labs/liquidation-on-kava-and-hard-f5122d9fac58).

#### **Kava Lend (formerly Hard)**

Kava Lend is a landing page platform with its native governance token HARD. Users can:

\- Supply liquidity to the platform and receive a certain percentage for it (depends on the type of asset).

\- Borrowing an asset against another asset.

\- Both liquidity providers and users who borrow are rewarded in HARD tokens.

Holders of the HARD token can participate in the governance and make suggestions for further development of the platform.

#### **Kava Swap (formerly Swap)**

Standard AMM swapper with its native SWP token. Users can add their tokens to liquidity pools and earn a portion of commission from swaps and earn additional income in SWP as a reward for providing liquidity.

Holders of the SWP token can also participate in the governance and make suggestions for the further development of the platform.

#### **Kava Earn**

Kava Earn is a platform where users can apply combined strategies in a few clicks to maximize profits (depending on the degree of risk). In other words, Kava Earn combines the functionality of Kava Mint, Kava Lend and Kava Swap and provides ready-made strategies. The goal of the platform is to provide safe strategies and high returns.

At the time of writing the review (mid-July 2022), only the BUSD strategy has been implemented on Kava Earn. You can read more details [here](https://medium.com/kava-labs/introducing-kava-earn-816078fb4ca).

### **Plans**

#### **3 quarter 2022**

\- Ethereum Bridge Launch. Will allow transfer of ERC-20 tokens and ETH from EVM compliant networks to Kava and vice versa.

\- Liquid Staking. Will allow KAVA steppers to use their assets more efficiently.

\- The earn yield optimizer (earn yield optimizer). It will allow users to automatically place their assets in the protocol with the highest yield.

\- Ability to sign SDK transactions in Metamask. Users will be able to use one wallet when making cross-chain transactions on EVM network.

\- Launch of a new loyalty and referral program.

\- Launch the Kava Foundation, a non-profit board of people/organizations that contribute a meaningful role to the Kava DAO and community.

#### **4 quarter 2022**

\- GameFi and NFT developer incentive program on the Kava network.

\- Launch of the bridge between Kava and Binance Smart Chain.

#### **Q1 2023**

\- Launch of CosmWasm support. Will make it faster and easier to run smart contracts on Cosmos co-chain and attract new developers.

\- Launch a bridge between Cosmos co-chain and Bitcoin. Will allow native bitcoin to be transmitted.

### **Important partnerships**

Integration with Multichain (formerly Anyswap), enabling the transfer of five ERC-20 tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, WBTC) between Kava Network and 8 other networks (ether and BNB among them). Read more [here.](https://medium.com/multichainorg/multichain-integrates-with-kava-network-448b7a37d184)

Partnering with Celer to enable cBridge to send USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, WBTC between Ethereum and Kava. Read more [here.](https://medium.com/kava-labs/kava-partners-with-celer-cbridge-to-enable-cross-chain-asset-transfers-3f75efbaed3c)

Partnership with Sushi. Read more [here.](https://medium.com/kava-labs/sushi-joins-the-kava-rise-program-with-a-combined-14m-allocation-5fd544defbdc)

Integration with Nervos, which after Ethereum Bridge launch will allow transfer of assets between Kava Network and Nerovs. It is also possible to add CKB token to Kava Lend and Kava Mint in the future.

It is important to note that Kava Network is young but very ambitious, as evidenced by their active efforts to enter into partnership agreements and attract new ecosystem projects and users (Kava Pioneer Program, which has announced partnerships with AutoFarm, Beefy Finance and Ren. A $750 million developer funding program was also recently launched).
