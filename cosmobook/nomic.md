## Nomic <a href="#nomic" id="nomic"></a>

Nomic is a Tier 1 blockchain that offers a decentralized, storage-free Bitcoin bridge. nBTC is a token that represents 1:1 ownership of Bitcoin in an IBC-compliant token. NOM is a token used to secure the network that can be used for Bitcoin rewards.

### Bitcoin Bridge <a href="#nomic-bitcoin-bridge" id="nomic-bitcoin-bridge"></a>

Nomic's first product is a bitcoin bridge to bring bitcoin to Cosmos. The bridge creates a new asset, nBTC, which is backed by IBC and fully backed by BTC. Nomic has developed a permissionless protocol that allows anyone to easily enter BTC in exchange for nBTC or withdraw nBTC in exchange for the network's BTC.

Nomic expects BTC/Osmosis pairs, DAO and DeFi protocols using BTC as a backup asset, and easy entry into the ecosystem due to Bitcoin's wide availability and liquidity.

To realize this vision, Nomic has developed a system that is more secure and permission-free than any other existing Bitcoin sidechain, combining proof-of-work and proof-of-stake to get the best of both worlds. Using Bitcoin's hashtag and the Tendermint consensus protocol, the Nomic network is able to provide high security and instant finality. It also creates a unique opportunity for those proof-of-stake to receive rewards in BTC.

### Network startup <a href="#network-launch" id="network-launch"></a>

To launch Nomic, the network will be rolled out in phases over the coming months.

#### Phase 1: Stakenet (February 2022) <a href="#phase-1-stakenet" id="phase-1-stakenet"></a>

Stakenet launches the network by issuing a NOM staking token via airdrop to ATOM holders and stackers, allowing them to stack NOM and start accruing rewards. Bridge functionality and NOM token transfer are disabled at this point, allowing the network to launch in a controlled manner where the impact of potential issues is minimized.

#### Phase 2: Upgrade the interconnection <a href="#phase-2-interchain-upgrade" id="phase-2-interchain-upgrade"></a>

The first network upgrade will connect Nomic with other Cosmos networks (via IBC) and with Bitcoin blockchain (via bridge protocol). This will be a significant milestone for the Cosmos ecosystem, as Nomic will be the first IBC network not based on Cosmos SDK, and Bitcoin blockchain will officially become part of The Interchain.

NOM token transfers will also be available at this stage (both locally and via IBC) - however, nBTC will still not be available for deposits or withdrawals.

#### Phase 3: A working Bitcoin Bridge <a href="#phase-3-full-bitcoin-bridge" id="phase-3-full-bitcoin-bridge"></a>

In this update, the network will fully enable Bitcoin Bridge, allowing everyone to deposit BTC in exchange for nBTC and withdraw nBTC in exchange for BTC. nBTC will also be available to move through IBCs, so at this time, BTC is expected to be instantly usable in Osmosis pools and other protocols.

### Details <a href="#airdrop-details" id="airdrop-details"></a>

The Stakenet launch includes an Airdrop for ATOM holders and Stakeholders to start circulating NOM steak token.

#### **Compliance with qualification requirements:** <a href="#sootvetstvie-kvalifikacionnym-trebovaniyam" id="sootvetstvie-kvalifikacionnym-trebovaniyam"></a>

* ATOM holders/stackers with at least 1.5 ATOM balance
* Image: Cosmos Block 9,150,000 (21 Jan 2022 at 11:22:43 UTC)

#### **Proliferation:** <a href="#rasprostranenie" id="rasprostranenie"></a>

* Total amount: 3,500,000 NOM
* Formula:
*
  * `(min(liquidBalance, 1000) + (4 * min(stakedBalance, 1000)) / 20.299325`
  * (Limit of 1,000 ATOM on both liquid balance and steaking balance, with 4x multiplier on steaking balance)
* Unlock: linear unlock starting 1 month after nBTC launch

**You can participate in the drop-in and start steaking NOM in the Nomic web app:** [**https://app.nomic.io**](https://app.nomic.io/) (Keplr Chrome extension required).

A total of two more Airdrop are planned - see Tokenomics section below.

On June 30, 2022, NOMIC announced the launch of the Bitcoin Upgrade program.

### The new features became available on **July 5 at 18:00 UTC**: <a href="#yzu0" id="yzu0"></a>

#### - Deposit and withdrawal of Bitcoin <a href="#depositing-and-withdrawing-bitcoin" id="depositing-and-withdrawing-bitcoin"></a>

After activating Bitcoin Upgrade, you can generate a special Bitcoin deposit address in the Nomic web application.

This Bitcoin address is linked to your Nomic account, and any Bitcoin sent to it (before the address expires and after 4 confirmations) will be issued in proportion to the amount of nBTC.

The nBTC can then be sent to any other Nomic address.

At any moment you can withdraw your nBTC to any Bitcoin address.

#### - Deposit fees and steaming fees in bitcoins <a href="#deposit-fees-and-bitcoin-staking-rewards" id="deposit-fees-and-bitcoin-staking-rewards"></a>

Bitcoin deposits are still in the experimental stage.

To prevent major deposit manipulation during this pilot phase, the network is charging **a fee of 20%** of the deposit amount. This fee is temporary and will be reduced to zero as the software undergoes a third-party security audit.

Deposit fees are deposited into a rewards fund which is distributed to NOM's stackers. The BTC staking fees will initially be small, but will increase over time as Nomic grows.

#### - Bitcoin update chart <a href="#bitcoin-upgrade-timeline" id="bitcoin-upgrade-timeline"></a>

The new Bitcoin features activated **on July 5 at 18:00 UTC**, and from then on the Nomic app sees rewards in Bitcoin .

Some of Bitcoin Bridge's most interesting security features (e.g., [emergency payouts](https://gist.github.com/mappum/da11e37f4e90891642a52621594d03f6#emergency-disbursal-process)) are not included in this release and will be gradually added over the next few updates. These security features will be key differences between Nomic and other bridges.

#### - Interchain upgrade timeline <a href="#interchain-upgrade-timeline" id="interchain-upgrade-timeline"></a>

The next major update will add support for nBTC IBC transfers to other Cosmos networks. Until then, nBTC listings will not appear.

#### - Updating Nomic Mainnet <a href="#nomic-mainnet-upgrade" id="nomic-mainnet-upgrade"></a>

The last major milestone for Nomic Bitcoin Bridge is the Mainnet upgrade.

The Nomic Mainnet Upgrade will follow the Interchain Upgrade and will include all major Bitcoin security features conveyed by NOM as well as complete the airdrop distribution.

### Tokenomics <a href="#tokenomics" id="tokenomics"></a>

The NOM token is used to secure the Nomic network.

The NOM distribution is modeled after the OSMO token. The network started with a stock of 21,000,000 NOM and the maximum stock after 9 years of inflation will be 210,000,000 NOM (as a tribute to Bitcoin's 21,000,000 BTC).

#### Initial distribution <a href="#initial-distribution" id="initial-distribution"></a>

**Total:** 21,000,000 NOM

* **Airdrop I** - 3,500,000 NOM

For ATOM Stackers and Holders - see details above.

* **Reserve for airfields II and III** - 7 000 000 NOM

The details of these issues have not yet been specified and will be included in upcoming network updates. Until then, these tokens are reserved but are not in circulation.

* **Strategic Reserve** - 10,500,000 NOM

Based on the standards of $OSMO and other Cosmos projects, the strategic reserve is used to build strategic partnerships for Nomic. It is held in multisig by the directors of the Nomic DAO Foundation and is intended strictly to meet Nomic's long-term goals. It will not be used for market sales and there will be vesting periods for strategic partners. All funds generated from the strategic reserve will be used to fund Nomic's development efforts.

At the discretion of multisig members, the reserve can also be used to delegate authority to validators who provide services to Nomic, such as managing infrastructure such as blockchain explorers and relays, or providing open source tools/resources to the ecosystem. In order to maintain network decentralization, the strategic reserve will not "hijack" a controlling share of the network.

#### Inflation graph <a href="#inflation-schedule" id="inflation-schedule"></a>

**Total distributed after Genesis:** 189,000,000 NOM

The NOM will be spread over 9 years, reducing the inflation rate by 1/3 each year.

* **Remuneration for steaking** - 47,250,000 NOM

Rewards will be distributed to NOM validators and delegates similar to other Cosmos networks.

* **Protocol incentives** - 85,050,000 NOM

This portion of NOM's offering will be used for future incentives to be determined by management or offered in future updates. For example, potential incentives could be paid to nBTC holders or liquidity providers for NOM or nBTC pools on Osmosis.

Since no protocol incentives will be in effect during the Stakenet run, the released NOM will accumulate in the pool for later distribution.

* **Developer rights vesting** - 47,250,000 NOM

The developer share will be distributed to the Nomic team over time. Note that because the network is decentralized, in the event that the Nomic team ceases to be the primary contributor to development, the developer's share may be redirected to vest in other teams or individuals.

* **Total pool** - 9,450,000 NOM

Part of the NOM will be collected into a pool that can be spent by network management. The Stakenet phase will not include a mechanism for spending these funds, so they will be accumulated until a later update that adds a management system.

### Long-term vision <a href="#long-term-vision" id="long-term-vision"></a>

Nomic has been under development since 2018 by the first Cosmos employees, and while at first glance it looks a lot like other Cosmos networks, it has fundamentally different DNA. The other networks are based on the Cosmos SDK, a standard framework that has many advantages, but also its disadvantages. Nomic uses Tendermint consensus, but is otherwise built on [a](https://github.com/nomic-io/orga) completely proprietary stack written in Rust, with an emphasis on performance and the ability to develop new features quickly.

While Nomic's bitcoin bridge is a valuable product in its own right, we see it as a building block for future projects. Nomic's real long-term focus is on building innovative DAOs, which Nomic believes are the most important new idea in the cryptocurrency space with potential yet to be unlocked.

➖Why is the deposit fee 20%?

Bitcoin deposits are still in the experimental phase! To prevent large deposits during this experimental phase, the network is charging a 20% deposit fee. This commission rate is temporary and will be reduced to zero as the software undergoes third-party security audits.

➖Why does the Nomic zenscan guide have limited features?

Be aware that NOMIC is built on a custom stack, so it is still limited to the number of Cosmos standard RPC/LCD endpoints currently available in the chain. As more endpoints become available, the explorer will provide more functionality.
