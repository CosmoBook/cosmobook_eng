There's only talk of droops in Cosmos...

Perhaps this article will be the most fictional. A lot of facts, examples, stories, and in the end, emotions, coincidences and coincidences.

I have not started to write the story about drops in space for a long time because after talking to many experienced cosmonauts I could not form my final opinion. It would be more correct to tell the story in the first person, but I am in Cosmos not long ago, so I will tell you what I gathered, and whether it is a fairy tale or a true story -DYOR)

Airdrop (let's not drown, drop, airdrop, fairdrop, rektdrop, etc. count as one and the same in this article) is a free distribution of project coins with fulfillment of necessary conditions (conditions are always conditional. For Cosmos, it is 99.99% of the time to stack specific coins thereby securing the network).

Airdrop is used as a marketing ploy to raise awareness about a new project as well as to attract as many people as possible, because many projects conduct an Airdrop before [the token sale](https://vc.ru/crypto/347930-s-chego-nachat-novichku-2-chto-takoe-ico-ido-ino-igo-i-dr).

Also drop gives value to a token at the start, because many people start merging them, thus increasing volume and attracting other participants.

Again, for astronauts pouring into a glass is not such an obvious story. Many prefer to hold on to the coins and send them to the steaming. At some point you realize at all that drop and staking are the 2 most used words here).

Usually drops are falling (here we should stipulate that coins are either sent to your purse immediately, or they need to be branded in the dapper of the project) to the following categories of participants ecosystem:

\-Stackers (much rarer holders) of $ATOM, $OSMO, $JUNO and other coins at certain validators. The choice of validator is also important. This is a separate topic that will be covered in our other materials. In short, I recommend not delegating to validators from the top ten, choose validators with whom you can communicate directly through their resources.Again, many validators make drops to their delegates. Well, look at the commission validator (rarely drop into the validators with zero commission, and high commissions are not profitable for you).

(There are many excellent Russian-speaking validators: Citadel.one, Posthuman, CryptoGopnik, MMS, CyberG, Postcapitalist, CosmosDrops, freak12techno, DVS, MZonder, Bro\_n\_bro, etc. Sorry, who have forgotten, email us and we will gladly add you to this list).

**-Voting** participants in the ecosystem. Yes, sometimes if you vote for a proposal (proposal) the way the project needs, it may drop you. Here again, I'll briefly mention again that it's important to vote. If you don't vote, your validator will vote for you, but projects appreciate it when you vote yourself.

**-Liquidity** providers in networks. Those who send their tokens to liquidity pools also get into drops (but less often). Usually, we're talking about $ATOM/$OSMO and $JUMO/$OSMO pools. But superfluid stacking does not fall under drops yet.

First you need to download and register a wallet. All wallets supporting Cosmos work can be seen [here](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/wallets). We made our review of Cosmos cryptocurrency wallets and dashboards, explore.

So now you need to build your portfolio.

So now you need to build your portfolio.

How to build a portfolio is a separate song, but you should always start with $ATOM. I haven't found any examples where drops have bypassed it. It is important to form a portfolio both in terms of coins and in terms of quantity. I'll show you some statistics to help you understand how different the conditions for drops are:

So after that tell me, how many coins do you need to drop?) Right, not clear, but the more the better. Fresh drop from Gelotto rolled out the following conditions:

Such serious demands (and I didn't get into the drop again) may be due to the heavy drawdown in coin values at the current bear, but we have what we have.

And recently $Evmos has been added to that list. It is now also an important resident of the ecosystem.

One experienced spaceman was asked to share how many drops he collected in a year. [A service](https://app.citadel.one/overall) from Citadel.one allows you to keep such statistics.

Yes, here too, not everything is transparent and obvious, but you can see that they are dropping regularly, and the number of coins is very different. It's also important to understand that you'll start getting regular drops after six months in staking. Until then, luck is much rarer. The project makes a snapshot, and announces it much later (from the established practice).

Aids on the Cosmos network can be very generous (funny too). There are some amazing examples:

Aids on the Cosmos network can be very generous (funny too). There are some amazing examples:

* You could get 4906 $STARS tokens for participating in staking and voting of Stargaze project (https://www.stargaze.zone/airdrop) that is equal to 127 $ at today's rate, it was much more expensive at the moment of drop.
* Osmosis - about $3,000 per $100ATOM in steak (the exchange rate is now severely depreciated).
* Juno is 1:1 to a staked $ATOM, that is, if you steamed $100 of $ATOM, you would get $100 of JUNO ($333 now and $4,000 at peak. The maximum you could get was $50K, but story 4,16,20 in the Juno article).
* Neta - in the neighborhood of $30,000 for steaming $25JUNO and at least 1 governance-goal (again, the rate has rolled in).
* Well, a very high profile (fat) drop from Evmos came out, which was broken into 4 stages (as branded here). Someone eventually managed to get 500+ $EVMOS at a price above $6 after the launch until April 29, 2022. And then some of them were put into the cup and the rest was branded at a lower price, of course. And the peculiarity was that users using Metamask and Ethereum got the drop as well.

The drops I caught (Genesis $L1, ORAI, Diffusion) were dropping pennies. I can't tell if it's just my bad luck (I've been in the Cosmos system since May 5, 2022 and my positions are still very much modest) or the bear, or if it's a general downward trend in drop values.
