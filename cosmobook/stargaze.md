## Stargaze

Stargaze is a PoS blockchain based on Cosmos SDK. Cosmos provides a decentralized set of validators, fast blockchain generation time and low gas usage.

In March 2021, the team stated that the Stargaze protocol would provide 3 key [functions](https://medium.com/stargaze-protocol/stargaze-a-decentralized-and-incentivized-social-protocol-efd095b9479c):

\- authors will be able to post their content in NFT format;

\- content curators will be able to be rewarded for early detection of good content and its evaluation;

\- the ability to purchase a content author token, in order to support the author.

These three features lay the foundation for an integrated social protocol that rewards both creators and curators by enabling crypto-native applications reminiscent of Twitter, TikTok, and the like.

In a typical proof-of-stake network, rewards for a block are received by validators. In Stargaze, these rewards are distributed between validators and users.

To put it another way, the Stargaze project was conceived as a social protocol that would allow fair distribution of rewards among those who create/consume content (authors and curators). Beautiful idea in the spirit of web3, but so far from the idea there is only NFT and the marketplace built around NFT.

By Q1 2022, Stargaze users will be able to create, curate and trade NFTs in the full Stargaze marketplace using their own token, $STARS. The $STARS token will be used for staking, participating in management, buying NFTs, signaling high-quality content through curation, and paying fees on the network.

The $STAR issuance schedule is similar to the Bitcoin issuance schedule. However, instead of half issuance, issuance will be reduced by 1/3 each year. Osmosis was the first protocol to use a "treading" token issuance schedule and was largely responsible for the design of Stargaze.

Stargaze started with an initial offering of 1 billion STARS. Another 1 billion STARS will be issued in the first year. With this "tretting" schedule, the next year's issuance will be \~667M STARS. This infinite sequence is a geometric series that leads to a fixed asymptotic maximum supply of 4 billion STARS.

Decentralization of Stargaze is enabled, in part, by genesis supply, a model for distributing most of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will keep a strategic supply of tokens and encourage protocol development by delegating authority to validators, engaging content creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.

### **Airdrop**

On October 11, 2021, a snapshot was made for Airdrop.

The aim of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stackers and liquidity providers are likely to be more active than just token holders (this is the approach used by many projects in the Cosmos ecosystem, stackers always count on new projects to drop). Therefore, Stargaze has conducted its airdrop among various network participants:

\- ATOM Stackers;

\- OSMO stackers or liquidity providers;

\- Stargaze validators at Cosmos Hub;

\- Stargaze validators on Osmosis;

\- Stargaze validators on the Regen Network.

You can check your awards [here](https://stargaze.zone/airdrop)**.**

#### **Distribution of remuneration**

The distribution of rewards for new tokens will be optimized to facilitate the NFT marketplace.

45% of the reward per block is allocated to NFT trading and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn returns by participating in trading and staking NFTs for certain periods of time.

#### **Rewards for steaking**

Validators (node operators) are rewarded for securing the network. Any user can also delegate his tokens to validators and receive remuneration proportional to his share of the stack (minus the commission set by validators).

After 3 testnet stages, 2 of which were incentivized, almost 100 validators were selected. They will receive 35% of all rewards in the network.

#### **Rewards for developers**

Initially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to Stargaze. Each account receives a certain weight set by management. If a developer no longer contributes, management can change their weighting or stop paying rewards altogether.

#### **Community Pool**

The community pool is the main DAO that manages the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software updates, community issues and more. The DAO will receive 5% of all network rewards.

### **What kind of project is this, anyway.**

Currently, Stargaze is a luncheonpad that already features 275 NFT collections that are traded for their own native STAR token, a marketplace, a platform where you can delegate (zastavka) your STAR and take part in voting. Also, the SWAP button will send you to OSMOSIS to buy STAR.

This is how the project positions itself on [the off-site](https://www.stargaze.zone/):

\- the first compatible L1 for the NFT;

\- NFT Launchpad;

\- NFT Marketplace;

\- owned by the community (apparently we are talking about DAO and decentralization);

\- zero gas;

\- carbon-neutral (Proof-of-Stake);

\- provided with 100+ validators;

\- programmable through CosmWasm;

\- interaction through Cosmos IBC.

Well, it is impossible not to mention that today Stargaze is one of the leaders in the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of volume flowing through IBCs:

The main news in the near future will be the possibility to interact with Ethereum via Gravity Bridge. I believe it will give the project a meaningful boost.
