# Drops of Cosmos

## Seems, there's lots of chatter about Cosmos air drops...

Perhaps this article will be the most belletristic. A lot of facts, examples, stories, and in the end, emotions, coincidences and eventualities.

I have not started to write a story about air drops in the COSMOS ecosystem for a long time, because after talking to many experienced cosmonauts I couldn't manage to form a final opinion. It would be more correct to tell the story from my perspective, but I¬¥m not that long ago in the Cosmos eco. So I will tell you what I could gather so far, and whether I think it's a fairytale or a true story (DYOR guys).

Airdrops (to not drown in all those keywords like, drop, airdrop, fairdrop, rektdrop, etc. let's count them as one and the same throughout the entire article) are a free distribution of a project¬¥s coins or tokens after fulfillment of necessary conditions 
(conditions are always conventional. For the Cosmos eco, it¬¥s staking specific coins 99.99% of the time and thereby securing the network).

Airdrops are used as a marketing tool to raise awareness about a new project as well as to attract as many people as possible, because many projects conduct an Airdrop before ICO¬¥s or [token sales (site is in russian lang)](https://vc.ru/crypto/347930-s-chego-nachat-novichku-2-chto-takoe-ico-ido-ino-igo-i-dr).

They give value to a token at the start, because many people start selling them, thus increasing trading volume and attracting other participants.

The ‚ÄúCosmonauts‚Äù don¬¥t really tend to sell right away. Many prefer to hold on to the coins and rather stake them. At some point you'll realize that ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù and ‚Äústaking‚Äù are the two most used words here üôÇ.

Usually airdrops are given out to the following categories of ecosystem participants (here we should stipulate that coins are either sent to your wallet address right away, or they need to be claimed via a project¬¥s dApp):

* **Stakers** of $ATOM, $OSMO, $JUNO and other coins and to those who delegate to certain validators (distribution to holders is rarer). The choice on which validator to stake is also important. This is a separate topic that will be covered in our other materials. 
In short, I recommend not delegating to validators from the top ten. 
Choose validators with whom you can communicate directly through their online resources. As I mentioned, many validators do drops to their delegators. Also, take a look at the commission of a validator (drops are rarely distributed to those who delegate to validators with zero commissions, and high commissions are not profitable for you).

* **Voting** participants of the ecosystem. Yeah. Sometimes, if you vote for a proposal the way the project wants, it may give out a drop to you. I'll briefly mention again that it's important to vote. If you don't vote, your validator will vote for you, but projects appreciate it when you vote yourself.

* **Liquidity** providers in different networks. Those who stake their tokens in liquidity pools also might be considered for drops (but less often). Usually, we're talking about $ATOM/$OSMO and $JUNO/$OSMO pools. But unfortunately superfluid stakers do not get considered in airdrop distributions yet.

### **How do I get started with airdrops?**

First you need to download a wallet app and register your public address on the blockchain. All wallets supporting the Cosmos Network can be found [here](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/wallets). 
We made our own review of Cosmos Network cryptocurrency wallets and dashboards, which you¬¥re kindly invited to explore.

Next up, you need to build your own portfolio.

How to build a portfolio is a separate issue, but you should always start with $ATOM. I haven't found any examples where it was bypassed by airdrops. 
The importance in forming a portfolio both in terms of coin types and in terms of quantity is present. I'll show you some statistics to help you understand how different the conditions for drops may be:

So after that tell me, how many coins do you need to stake to get airdropped? üôÇ 
Yep, not clear. But the more the better. The recent drop from Gelotto was rolled out with following conditions:

Such serious demands (and I wasn't eligible for the drop again) may be due to the heavy drawdown in coin values at the current bear market. But we have what we have.

$EVMOS has been added to that list, recently as well. It is now also an important part of the ecosystem.

An experienced cosmonaut was asked to share how many drops he collected in a year. [A service](https://app.citadel.one/overall) from Citadel.one allows you to make such statistics.

I agree that not everything is transparent and obvious here, but you can see that airdrops are distributed regularly and the quantity of coins is pretty different. It's also important to understand that you'll start getting regular drops just after about six months of staking. Until then, you may not have that much luck. Projects make snapshots and announce their drops at a much later time point (as practice shows).

I¬¥m providing you [an interesting spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CjRglycJ8DwJ4-ZE5PUwSFh3wGgEkfc\_u52-YlripGw/edit#gid=1777801625) on drops for your own study.

### **How much money can I make?**

Airdrops on the Cosmos Network can be very generous (and funny, too). There are some amazing examples:

* You could get 4906 $STARS coins which equal $127 at today's rate, for participating in staking and voting in the Stargaze project (https://www.stargaze.zone/airdrop). The drop was worth much more at the moment of distribution, though.
* Osmosis - about $3,000 for 100 staked $ATOM (the exchange rate is now severely depreciated).
* Juno 1:1 distribution to staked $ATOM. Means, if you staked 100 $ATOMs, you would've gotten 100 JUNO (worth around $333 now and was worth $4,000 at ATH. The maximum you could¬¥ve gotten was $50K, but you can learn more about that in my Juno article).
* Neta - around $30,000 for staking 25 $JUNO and participating in at least one governance proposal (again, the price rate has been killed by now).
* And a very high profiled (fat) ‚Äúrektdrop‚Äù from EVMOS, which claim procedure was split into four stages. People could manage to get 500+ $EVMOS at a price above $6 after the launch and until April 29th 2022. Of course, some of them were sold right away and the rest that was left to be claimed was trading at a lower price. And the peculiarity was that Metamask and Ethereum users were eligible for the drop as well.

The drops I claimed (Genesis $L1, ORAI, Diffusion) equaled pennies. I can't tell if it's just my bad luck, the bear market, or if it's a general downward trend in airdrop values (I've been in the Cosmos ecosystem since May 5th, 2022 and my positions are still very modest).

Today, 21.07.2022, Gelotto is doing an airdrop (token not traded and price not clear as yet).
