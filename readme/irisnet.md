## IRISnet

IRISnet (aka IRIS hub) is a network intended to provide a technological foundation facilitating creation of next generation distributed business applications. The IRISnet development teams include [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/), which created the Tendermint consensus mechanism and the Cosmos project, and [Bianjie](http://www.bianjie.ai/) , a blockchain development team based in Shanghai.

The idea behind IRISnet is to become a regional hub linking the real economy (business applications) to the rest of the Cosmos ecosystem (digital economy). Hence, incidentally, the name Iris - it is the ancient Greek goddess of the rainbow, the messenger of the gods. That is, she connects one world (gods) with the earth (and even the underworld üòà).

The IRIS net is supposed to be used for dApp interaction of medical advice, e.g., with a private medical data bank. That kind of thing, mass-adoption.

### **How it works** <a href="#utvy" id="utvy"></a>

IRIShub is built on Cosmos-SDK and inherits the modular SDK architecture. That is, this hub technically copies CosmosHub (the technical part on the hub is in the first part) All the technical doc I found looks like they are trying to sell the technology to those who have banned crypto in the country.

The diagram above shows that the IRIS network has the same topology as the Cosmos network. Although the IRIS network focuses on providing a solution for distributed business applications, it is still part of the Cosmos ecosystem. All zones connected to IRIShub can communicate with any other zone on the Cosmos network using the standard IBC protocol.

Services in IRIS are prefixed with "i", such as iServiceü§£

Consumers and suppliers are invited to interact with each other through _end_ points, which are located in the blockchain. There are two kinds of endpoints, the _request table_ and the _response table_. Service requests are sent to the Request table, tracked there by the vendors involved. Then they accept and process the requests addressed to them; the results of the service (or errors) are sent back to the Response tables, which, in turn, are tracked and accepted by the consumers.

### Key players in IRISnet:

* IRIS service providers are users who offer implementations of one or more iService and often act as representatives of offchain services and resources. Providers track and process incoming requests and send responses back to the network. A provider can simultaneously act as a consumer, sending requests to other providers. Providers charge for any services they can offer, and the default service charge is specified in the IRIS token.
* IRIS consumers are those users who use iServices, sending requests to designated provider endpoints and receiving responses from the appropriate providers.
* IRIS Service Profilers are special consumers who act on behalf of IRIS Foundation Limited, a Hong Kong limited liability company that takes the lead in building the IRIS network. Profilers are the only users who are allowed to call iServices in _profiling mode_, which is designed to create and maintain objective profiles of the suppliers that consumers turn to to verify suppliers.
* IRIS Service arbitrators are self-proclaimed users who, working collectively, review consumer complaints about provider performance. At this point, judging by the doc, not implemented.

According to [Mapofzones](https://mapofzones.com/zone?period=24\&source=irishub-1\&tableOrderBy=volume\_in\&tableOrderSort=desc\&testnet=false), IRIS net is connected to 15 zones (or rather, 14 zones and one hub,-hello, Homlin-nerd).

At the same time, all the movement-paris at five:

It's important to realize that IRISnet is a Chinese project, so let's keep our fingers crossed and wish us luck!

### **$IRIS** <a href="#s9yo" id="s9yo"></a>

The IRIS token has a standard utility:

* steaming to maintain the network;
* commission payment;
* havernance.

Total supply: 2 billion tokens.

Distribution: private sale 25%, Bianjie development team 15%, Tendermint team 10%, IRIS foundation 15%, ecosystem development 30% (grants to potential users; awards to outstanding partners), airdrop 5%.

### **Ecosystem** <a href="#hlmx" id="hlmx"></a>

#### **Wallet**

Wallet [https://www.rainbow.one/ ](https://www.rainbow.one/)supports IRISnet, Cosmos and BSC. It's stated to transfer tokens from BSC to IRIS net, so it's a potential usecase to input asserts from EVM to Cosmos.

#### **Dashboard**

Transactions can be monitored here [https://irishub.iobscan.io/](https://irishub.iobscan.io/). There is also voting and the current state of the network.

I liked the dashboard for its design and UI. If you plan to ape in this hub, it's probably enough for all your network activities.

Zones connected to the hub, the status of IBC channels and IBC transactions can be conveniently tracked at [https://ibc.iobscan.io/](https://ibc.iobscan.io/)

IBC transactions from Osmosis to IRIS net

#### **Coinswap (AMM)**

[Here](https://coinswap.market/) you can exchange tokens, mine liquidity and foraging.

Additionally, there is zone for NFT (what without whole blockchain, i.e. zone, in space-like network!) [https://www.uptick.network](https://www.uptick.network/#Ecosystem),

On a side note, the IRIS net is now up and running with StaFiHub, which means that soon Liquid Staking will be coming to the network. You can browse the testnet [here](https://test-app.stafihub.io/rToken).
