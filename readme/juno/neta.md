# Neta

NETA is money in the Juno zone. The token was created and distributed by [Core-1](https://docs.junonetwork.io/juno/juno-developers#core-1), the core Juno Network development team. The only utility of $NETA is to be a scarce decentralized asset for savings not only in the Juno zone, but also in Cosmos in general.

All tokens were distributed via airdrop to $Juno stackers in the following quantities:

1. _Staking from 25 JUNO = 1 NETA_.
2. _User voted on at least one sentence = 10 additional NETA_
3. _User voted on all sentences = 5 additional NETAs_.
4. _User delegated at least one validator from outside the top 20 = 0.2 additional NETA_

The total offer was 32950 NETA. The snapshot included users who snapped up JUNO before the Moneta update on December 15, 2021. This is the same update that brought smart contracts to Juno. Claims were available from February 1 to 28 and...1063.4 NETAs went unclaimed and were burned. Total, sapply $3,1886.6 $NETA.

Thus, the maximum number of tokens available for branding was 16.2 per wallet. All tokens were distributed among 5,372 wallets. For those who like visual statistics, below are charts from Twitter user @iamtherealjohn\_

I should note that the haip (if that's what you can call an event related to the drop on 5372 wallets) around NETA was not bad. They managed to call it bitcoin in space ([pruf](https://chaindebrief.com/neta-decentralized-inter-chain-store-of-value-juno-network/)), wrote that those who sold 2k+ would regret it later ([pruf](https://twitter.com/ShutenDoji20/status/1489707751924240395?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw)), etc. As of today, the reality is that those who leaked right after the stigma made good money. Look at how the price has changed:

But we are not here for the sake of flip, but for the sake of space. The excitement in ecosystem chats hasn't died down, so let's see what else is out there besides FOMO)))

### Neta DAO <a href="#neta-dao" id="neta-dao"></a>

The tweet from the official account explicitly states that Neta is not a project, and that all development depends on the community. That is, core-1, after the initial distribution of the token, is not responsible for it.

![](https://telegra.ph/file/caa35b6c17361bd41bed2.png)

This is why the Neta DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) run by $NETA holders, has emerged to act as a community gas pedal to fund and develop $NETA and the Neta DAO. The proposal originated on 05/25/2022 on Commonwealth, initiated by cryptomuse, envy, GlowGator, Heisenberg1, HODLer, Massv, Paul123, TrickyCrypto, whiskey, wtrsld.juno. You can read the document here [https://netadaozone-backup.neocities.org/docs/neta-dao-statement-2022-05-25.pdf](https://netadaozone-backup.neocities.org/docs/neta-dao-statement-2022-05-25.pdf).

At the same time, the main Neta discord community is still working, although the discussions are very sluggish.

The guys from Neta DAO in the disclaimer write that the organization left the official discord, but will call themselves Neta DAO, because they came up with it first. However, they do not deny that there may be several such organizations.

The DAO provides benefits and privileges such as:

**Community.** By locking your $NETAs into the Neta DAO, you help build a powerful Neta DAO community for the Neta and Juno ecosystems. For this, you'll receive benefits such as airdrops, NFT exclusives, and NFT whitelists.

**Choice of direction.** As a member of the Neta DAO community, everyone can not only voice their opinion through Commonweatlh, but also participate in DAO voting.

**Treasury.** You will play a key role in curating and voting on the allocation and use of DAO Treasury funds and the LP incentive pool. These funds will accelerate teams creating dApps, services, NFTs, games, and other protocols.

All of this is expected, along with the ability to lock your $Neta. There has already been a drop from Gelotto, and there will probably be a drop from IDOLS NFT [https://twitter.com/BeholdIdols](https://twitter.com/BeholdIdols), as the tweet mentions @Neta\_DAO [https://twitter.com/Neta\_DAO](https://twitter.com/Neta\_DAO), and the same Neta DAO in the collection presentation in the footers.

***

There's a lot of second-guessing in this review, let me summarize the facts and then my thoughts and conclusions on them.

### **Facts:** <a href="#zib5" id="zib5"></a>

1. The $Neta token was developed by Core-1, the creators of Juno. Their tweet [https://mobile.twitter.com/CRootHQ](https://mobile.twitter.com/CRootHQ) says so;
2. There was already a drop for holding Neta. Yes, I mean gelotto [https://gelotto.io/airdrop](https://gelotto.io/airdrop)
3. The community around $Neta, though sluggish, is making decentralized organizations. There are two of them now: the main one, which arose with Neta.money, and Neta DAO, which split off on May 25, 2022 and is sinking for DAO.

#### **Thoughts and Conclusions:** <a href="#yn2z" id="yn2z"></a>

1. It is likely that the $Neta hold will be a kind of flag indicating early-supporter Juno. Also, given that the token was developed by the founders of the Juno zone, perhaps this will be taken into account in the allocation of tokens for the next offspring.
2. If the DAO is launched, it is possible to participate in the management for the sake of the movement, as well as for the plushies that Neta DAO promises.

### 18.08.2022 Staking and DAO

Staking Neta started on 8/11/2022

Contract Address: juno1c5v6jkmre5xa9vf9aas6yxewc7aqmjy0rlkkyk4d88pnwuhclyhsrhhnhns6

Staking in a Neta DAO only provides management rights to the DAO - there are no rewards from staking in a DAO. You will not receive any income in the form of more NETA or other coin/token.

Unlock Period: As decided by the community, this period is initially 91 days. This is a longer unlock period than other tokens as a security deterrent due to the unique and innovative (according to the authors) nature of Neta DAO.

Note: Idols NFT will be taking a snapshot of Neta DAO stackers to give these wallets early access to Idols mining at a discounted price.

#### What is Neta DAO?

The Neta DAO is a community effort to accelerate the development and implementation of the Juno Network and the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

Because NETA was created not only for early adopters of JUNO, but also for early and active management participants, the Neta DAO seeks to honor and build on this foundation through a number of activities and potential sub-DAOs. These include, but are not limited to: validating networks, participating as an organized entity in their governance, identifying teams/dApps/public resources/documentation and distributing grants to developers, producing educational materials on current governance offerings and ecosystem issues, brainstorming type work for new governance mechanisms, working to create "best practices" for Proof of Stake validation, etc. This list is not exclusive or accurate.

#### What is the structure of the DAO?

The Neta DAO is, and will continue to be, a collective run by its members without a figurehead. Because of the unique nature of NETA drop and the fact that Neta DAO is focused on developing public/network resources and further decentralizing the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole, NETA seeks to harness the power and conviction of its many members to help realize its goals: the public good requires more than one person or faction.

Neta DAO currently operates as an unincorporated non-profit organization and is working to establish an explicit non-profit structure to establish jurisdiction and formally limit any taxation and liability issues that might affect DAO members.

#### DAO management

Neta DAO has several methods of protecting its members' shares. Because the NETA token is a scarce decentralized store of value with a closed contract, NETA has created a number of checks and balances for offerings.

Neta DAO has:

#### 91-Day Release Period

The token unlock period is set at 91 days when the DAO is created, to make it clear that NETA is here to stay. In the future, there are plans to introduce multiple levels of unlock period, subject to community discussion and approval.

#### Organizational Multisig.

The Neta DAO can accept and distribute funds to projects or teams at the discretion of the DAO leadership; therefore, they need protection from abusers. In the interim, NETA created a 9-member Multisig with a pass threshold of 6 out of 9, which will be responsible for ensuring that funds are used in accordance with the wishes of the community. Also, if the DAO needs to move to a new version of the DAO contracts, the Tregieri will be able to handle it without logistical problems, as has happened with some of the sister DAOs.

#### Executive Multisig.

Because NETA is a scarcity supply token that was fully liquid and widely distributed when it was created, this leads to unique circumstances related to distribution and, therefore, management. Neta DAO has created an executor function in its DAODAO instance that allows a multisig of 9 members (with a pass threshold of 6 out of 9) to reject any malicious offer from the DAO before it passes. This is done to protect the community and the funds invested by members in the DAO, and to prevent the threat of DAO activity from bad players with big capital that cannot be countered.

#### Operational Multisig.

Like any other organization, Neta DAO will have a multisig to handle operating costs, they are listed below:

* Basic validator fee for Poroburu $125 per month (validator management, upgrades, best practices). If a new network is added, this will add $125 per validator fee.
* netadao.zone website domain ($50/year approximately)
* Akash hosting ($100/year approx.) - may vary depending on site or app additions

Total $140 USD/month

#### Multisig Composition

Membership: The Tregieri and Executor multisigs are "6 of 9" multisigs: they are multisigs of 9 members that require 6 of the 9 members to vote for or against a motion to be carried or not to be carried. Initial multisig compositions have the following:

* 5 DAO members who have regularly attended community meetings, done extensive work and research on DAO initiatives, and have demonstrated their dedication to the DAO from the beginning.
* 4 Interchain influencers: people who are either major contributors to prominent projects built on Juno or members of the network itself.

This composition ensures a healthy mix of DAO members and familiar "outside" figures to accept or reject proposals. For example, if members of the DAO community vote unanimously in favor of a proposal, the signature of one of the outside figures in the multisig will be required.

#### Proposals:

Neta DAO proposals will be structured with these parameters in mind:

* Deposit required: 15 NETA
* Voting duration: 5 days
* Re-voting? You can change your vote.
* Quorum: 10%
* Passing threshold: Most
* Refunds for unsuccessful offers: None (all deposits for unsuccessful offers will go to Neta DAO coffers)

#### Why is there no reward for steaking?

With current business legislation as it is, it is not possible to run a DAO that distributes income to stakeholders potentially worldwide, without invasive KYC procedures and complicated tax issues.
