## Omniflix <a href="#oksn" id="oksn"></a>

OmniFlix Network (formerly known as FreeFlexMedia Network) – is a p2p network for creators and communities that allows to achieve efficiency in management, distribution and monetization of user-generated content.

The network was designed to solve the following problems:

* Low audience reach&#x20;
* Lack of tools for cooperation in content creating and its distribution and monetization
* Insufficiently sovereign infrastructure

The team emphasizes that OmniFlix is not an app or a platform, it is a network. At the same time, since OmniFlix implements the existing set of protocols, it is not a protocol itself. However, OmniFlix can develop required protocols that might be missing.

OmniFlix network uses three types of nodes: 1) Validator 2) Relayer 3) Storage. Validator is responsible for block production and governance (on behalf of delegators), relayer moves packets from one chain to another, and storage delivers content within the network.

Despite the fact that the mainnet launch is scheduled for Q4, 2022, you can already try OmniFlix by yourself and even buy some NFTs.

At the moment the ecosystem consists of four components: OmniFlix Studio, OmniFlix Market, OmniFlixin Sync and StreamPay. **OmniFlix Studio** is an app that allows to create, mint, manage, distribute and monetize content. **OmniFlix Market** is used to list NFTs, collect and transfer tokens (including IBC transfers). You can see a good example of multi-chain power on the screenshot below. Initially, CryptoGopniks are minted on Cosmos Hub ( by the way, they cost 2.28 ATOM).&#x20;

One of the remarkable chain's dApp is one of the HackAtom IV participants, **StreamPay**. StreamPay is a streaming payments service for Cosmos-based chains. Its module is similar to CosmWasm. The service has its own token — SPAY, but other IBC tokens, for instance, FLIX and JUNOX, are also supported.

The general idea is this: Supposing, Potap wants to pay for Lilian's service and set aside 100 SPAY for that purpose. Potap selects Lili's wallet as a recipient address, and then sets start and end time for the service. During that time payment will be evenly distributed to blocks.

The service is crude for now, but StreamPay plans to implement stop payments, on-chain triggers at start/end, adaptive adjustment of the payment share, etc.
