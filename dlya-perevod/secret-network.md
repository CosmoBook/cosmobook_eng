## Secret Network

**SECRET NETWORK** is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts (according to the company itself).

Most blockchains that support smart contracts, such as Ethereum, are public by default. This means that all data used in their smart contracts is public. Secret Network enhances traditional smart contracts by supporting encrypted input and output data, as well as encrypted smart contract state data. That is, Secret Network provides data privacy for sensitive information stored on the blockchain.

Privacy is essential to the security and adoption of all Web3 sectors - from DeFi to meta-villages. Secret Network brings new and unique privacy features to this space and can be the foundation for the next generation of successful Web3 applications.

**Secret Network's goal** is to simplify the adoption and usability of decentralized technologies by providing a wide range of tools and applications designed to preserve user privacy. And that privacy is enabled by a new generation of smart contracts - Secret Contracts.

**The Secret Foundation** is an organization that promotes the growth of the Secret Network ecosystem. To do this, the Secret Foundation promotes privacy as a public good.

Secret Foundation helps establish effective and efficient management practices for the community and their foundation. They also produce educational content and support a number of committees that help empower individual users and projects.

### **Protocol**

Secret Network, thanks to Cosmos IBC, can communicate with a range of other networks. The Secret Network protocol uses key management, encryption protocols, and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to achieve data privacy. TEEs ensure that nodes cannot view calculations that take place in a trusted environment, preserving the confidentiality of the data underlying the calculations. Secret Network's underlying transaction registry is public; a native SCRT token is used for management, transactions, and gas fees. The protocol implements programmable privacy, which is defined as arbitrarily complex application data privacy controls. Programmable privacy allows tokens to be wrapped in their private and interchangeable equivalent using the Secret Network SNIP-20 standard via Secret Contract. Blocks are created and added approximately every six seconds with a soft limit of approximately twenty-two transactions per second due to the gas limit per block. The current protocol architecture and design can theoretically support up to 10,000 transactions per second.



### **Examples of using the capabilities of the Secret Network**

The scheme provides an opportunity to secretly withdraw funds from a wallet (say, that was discredited on CEX) to a newly created wallet. The scheme also allows you to secretly transfer funds from your wallet to someone else's (say, to make a payment). If the payment is made through an intermediary wallet, even the recipient will not be able to determine where the funds came from.

The Sienna Swap is presented here to show the ability to swap your coin for other secret coins, so that even the number of coins sent and received will not allow at least indirectly linking your 2 wallets.

Another major advantage of a Secret Network is the inability to use frontrunning against you:

Speaking about features and capabilities of Secret Network I strongly recommend you to watch [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVopimoM8Jk) (time-code 1:27:00) with Anton Pavlutsky, CEO of Citadel.one.

### **Validators**

The default number of validator nodes in the Secret Network is fifty, with the possibility of more nodes joining the network once changes to the protocol parameters are agreed. Validators are rewarded with transaction fees and block signing rewards.

Users can delegate tokens to validators and just like validators receive rewards (and must pay a small percentage of the rewards to validators).

### **Tokenomics**

Secret Network has a variable inflation rate that ranges from 7% to 15% . As of July 2022, there were about 70 million SCRTs in circulation and the total supply is about 190 million SCRTs. Validator nodes can charge a commission on delegated SCRTs. Currently, the minimum commission rate is 0% and the maximum is 20%. The validator commission rate can change by no more than 1% every twenty-four hours. In addition to the commission rate, there are two additional sets of commissions on earned rewards for blocks: community fee (2%) and Secret Foundation fee (15%). The community fee is taken from all block rewards and sent to a pool known as the Community Pool. This pool is used to fund network management offerings.

In the future, Secret Network technology may be able to affect all areas in which blockchain technology can be used. Health care, finance, banking, government, communications, media, supply chains, voting, music and entertainment, real estate, insurance, gambling, messaging and many others. The Secret Network protocol using TEEs is the de facto programmable privacy standard for contract development for the future of Web 3.0.

### **Secret Bridges**

Secret Ethereum Bridge \*\*\*\*, a bridge to the Ethereum network, was launched \*\*\*\* on December 15, 2020 and is the first of many bridges to other ecosystems. This bridge allowed users to exchange Ethereum and fourteen other ERC-20s for their Secret equivalent SNIP-20.

Secret Bridges connect the Secret Network with other blockchain networks, allowing users from different ecosystems to create privacy-preserving versions of their assets, called Secret Tokens. Secret Tokens are a very interesting concept: they are programmable, like ERC-20, and can be used in applications, but remain private by default, like Monero and similar coins. Once assets cross the Secret Bridge in the form of Secret Tokens, they can be used in Secret DeFi applications, which by default are private and compatible with multiple networks, which means the assets support different blockchain ecosystems.

Secret already allows a number of tokens to be moved and exchanged on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. The new bridges will provide the same access and functionality for other networks.

Secret Bridges uses multisig for authorization. 3 out of 5 operators trusted to manage the bridge must approve (sign) the transaction in order for it to be executed. These operators are very reputable staking operators - Figment, Staked, B-Harvest, Citadel.one and Enigma.

The multi-signature authorization process makes it much more difficult to compromise Secret Bridges, eliminating the single point of failure that is a problem for single-signature systems.

### **Secret NFTs**

Secret NFTs are NFTs with programmable privacy features.

In other words, verifiable ownership of goods and experiences need not be public! In the Secret Network, the authentication process takes place without compromising any private data, including proof of authenticity and translations.
